                        Soo, if you're on this website, it means that it's finally 17th July, the day we Lassans had been waiting for!
                        Today is the 12th Lassan Diwas (1st one in 2014)! 11 years ago today, Yes Yes Bhai made a decision to start a
                        YouTube channel, and back then he didn't even know how far that decision would take him! His hard work, efforts
                        and consistency bore fruit, and today he has crores of supporters whom he chose to call Lassans! We are so
                        happy Nischay bhaiya, we wish you an ecstatic Lassan Diwas! You are the best, we dota you bhraaataa shreeeeee!!
                        Your Lassans love you always and forever! हाथ नहीं छोड़ना, साथ नहीं छोड़ना!

                        This year I wanted to do something special for Lassan Diwas that wasn't done by Lassans ever before! So, I came up with this idea of
                        making a website for Lassan Diwas to shower our love upon you! I asked some Lassans what they thought about my idea and if they
                        wanted to help, and they agreed! So today we are presenting to you a website for you with content like fan art, memes & edits for you!
                        We tried in every way to keep things wholesome and have been working on this from 31st March 2024, we hope that you enjoy this gift!
                        Also, we hope to connect with you on discord, talk, play games like among us & skribbl, only if that's okay with you!
